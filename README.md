# random-image

Tool for displaying images in a folder (and all nested folders) in a random order. Keeps track of what you have already reviewed. Current lesson is persistent between sessions.

You can create your own queue, just modify the queue in lessonConfig.json as you see fit and save the file.

Accepted file extensions are inside config/appConfig.js. Edit as necessary. Lowercase "jpg" will work for .JPG files, same goes for other extensions.

In case anything goes wrong, delete config/lessonConfig.json to have it regenerated.
